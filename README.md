## Website Information

### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to present myself as a full stack developer to potential employers. The website highlights the skills I have gained as a dev and gives the audience an idea of what I'm like as a person as well.

It also gave me an opportunity to work on my design and project management skills.



### Functionality

The website is fairly simple and is built using HTML5 and CSS3. It contains a Font Awesome script so that Font Awesome icons can be included but other than that it uses no other pre-made frameworks or libraries.

There are four main pages of the site that all link together through a navbar: home, about, work blog, and contact. It also has six additional pages that act as blog/project posts for some of the work I've done so far. These are accessed through the work blog page.

### Features

#### Navbar

The navbar is used to navigate through the different pages of the website. If the device screen width is above 768px, the navbar runs along the top of each page and is fixed to the top. If the device screen width is less, the navbar collapses and in it's place will be a clickable hamburger that will open the nav as a sidebar when clicked.

#### Background colours

Used to add colour to the site. There aren't a whole lot of images on the site so colour is used to add some impact to the pages that don't contain a lot of info like the home and contact pages.

#### Icons

Icons are used as links to external sites like my GitHub and LinkedIn. This is so a potential employer can find other professional info in me through my site.

#### Buttons

Buttons are used as links to different pages in the site. The are an alternative to the navbar in some cases and are also the only linking access point to the blog posts.

#### Images

Images are mostly of some of the projects I've done. They used to give the audience an look at my work. There is also a picture of myself on the About page to show people what I look like.

#### Profile

The profile is a short text description of myself. It is purely to provide information to the audience.

#### Lists

There are two lists on the About page to give further information about my skills and interests. The info has been implemented as lists to improve readability. 

#### Footer

The footer sites at the bottom of the page and contains information on the website's author, myself and the year the site was published.

#### Cards

There are two card styles in the site. The first is on the work blog page and is used to contain images of each project, it's name, date, and a button to go to a page with more info on the project.

The second is style is on the individual blog/project posts pages. It's used to contain a larger image of the project as well as some text info on each. The text info is just Lorem Ipsum filler text.

#### Call to Action

There are a couple calls to action in the site. Used to get the audience to behave in a certain way, such as a call to contact me on the contact page.

#### Form

There is a form on the contact page that allows the audience to leave there name, email, and a message that will be sent to my email. The form uses Formspree to handle the delivery of the message to my email.

#### Effects

Many of the links in the site have hover effects added to them. This is partially to make the site more interactive and exciting for the audience, and also just to show off some of the things I can do with CSS.

## Screenshots

Below are screenshots of my two favourite pages. This first is the homepage which I think looks quite good and makes an impact on the audience upon arriving to my site.

The second is the work blog page. I've included it because I spent a lot of time fiddling with the card style on this page. It's not incredible but I'm happy with is regardless.
